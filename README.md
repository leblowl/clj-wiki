# clj-wiki

Ideas for this project:

Wiki/collaboration tool for viewing/editing/contributing/learning about new legislation in local government. Just the other day someone posted a Change.org petition that encouraged me to support a few pieces of legislation. I would have liked to cast my vote, however I couldn't understand the details of the proposed bills. It would be nice to have a platform for more open collaboration and learning regarding legislation.
